        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g.,
          having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced server side
          versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than simply
          downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for
          example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic
          control over them.</p>
        <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as <code>Array</code>, <code>Date</code>, and
          <code>Math</code>, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements.
          Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
          example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
            Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on
            an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
          <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a
            server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide
            continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations
            on a server.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the webpage (DOM) looks. And, likewise, Node.js
          JavaScript on the server can respond to custom requests from code written in the browser.</p>

      <article>
        <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
          language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows
          most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it
          was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
        <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime
          system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has
          a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
          provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also
          supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects,
          executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
        <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes,
          and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you
          do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly
          typed.</p>
        <p> Java is a class-based programming language designed for fast execution and type safety. Type safety means,
          for instance, that you can't cast a Java integer into an object reference or access private memory by
          corrupting Java bytecodes. Java's class-based model means that programs consist exclusively of classes and
          their methods. Java's class inheritance and strong typing generally require tightly coupled object
          hierarchies. These requirements make Java programming more complex than JavaScript programming.</p>
        <p>In contrast, JavaScript descends in spirit from a line of smaller, dynamically typed languages such as
          HyperTalk and dBASE. These scripting languages offer programming tools to a much wider audience because of
          their easier syntax, specialized built-in functionality, and minimal requirements for object creation.</p>
        <p>For more information on the differences between JavaScript and Java, see the chapter Details of the object
          model.</p>

      <header>JavaScript and the ECMAScript specification</header>
      <article>
        <p>JavaScript is standardized at Ecma International — the European association for standardizing information and
          communication systems (ECMA was formerly an acronym for the European Computer Manufacturers Association) to
          deliver a standardized, international programming language based on JavaScript. This standardized version of
          JavaScript, called ECMAScript, behaves the same way in all applications that support the standard. Companies
          can use the open standard language to develop their implementation of JavaScript. The ECMAScript standard is
          documented in the ECMA-262 specification. See New in JavaScript to learn more about different versions of
          JavaScript and ECMAScript specification editions.</p>
        <p>The ECMA-262 standard is also approved by the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) as
          ISO-16262. You can also find the specification on the Ecma International website. The ECMAScript specification
          does not describe the Document Object Model (DOM), which is standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium
          (W3C) and/or WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group). The DOM defines the way in which
          HTML document objects are exposed to your script. To get a better idea about the different technologies that
          are used when programming with JavaScript, consult the article JavaScript technologies overview.</p>
        <h3>JavaScript documentation versus the ECMAScript specification</h3>
        <p>The ECMAScript specification is a set of requirements for implementing ECMAScript. It is useful if you want
          to implement standards-compliant language features in your ECMAScript implementation or engine (such as
          SpiderMonkey in Firefox, or V8 in Chrome).</p>
        <p>The ECMAScript document is not intended to help script programmers. Use the JavaScript documentation for
          information when writing scripts.</p>
        <p>The ECMAScript specification uses terminology and syntax that may be unfamiliar to a JavaScript programmer.
          Although the description of the language may differ in ECMAScript, the language itself remains the same.
          JavaScript supports all functionality outlined in the ECMAScript specification.</p>
        <p>The JavaScript documentation describes aspects of the language that are appropriate for a JavaScript
          programmer.</p>

    <section class="main-section" id="Getting_started_with_JavaScript">
      <header>Getting started with JavaScript</header>
      <article>
        <p>Getting started with JavaScript is easy: all you need is a modern Web browser. This guide includes some
          JavaScript features which are only currently available in the latest versions of Firefox, so using the most
          recent version of Firefox is recommended.</p>
        <p>The Web Console tool built into Firefox is useful for experimenting with JavaScript; you can use it into two
          modes: single-line input mode, and multi-line input mode.</p>
        <h3>Single-line input in the Web Console</h3>
        <p>The Web Console shows you information about the currently loaded Web page, and also includes a JavaScript
          interpreter that you can use to execute JavaScript expressions in the current page.</p>
        <p>To open the Web Console (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd> on Windows and Linux or Cmd-Option-K
          on Mac), open the Tools menu in Firefox, and select "Developer ▶ Web Console".</p>
        <p>The Web Console appears at the bottom of the browser window. Along the bottom of the console is an input line
          that you can use to enter JavaScript, and the output appears in the panel above:</p>
        <img src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/16569/2019-04-04_00-15-29.png" id="main-image">
        <p>The console works the exact same way as <code>eval</code>: the last expression entered is returned. For the
          sake of simplicity, it can be imagined that every time something is entered into the console, it is actual
          surrounded by <code>console.log</code> around <code>eval</code>, like so.</p>
        <pre>
        function greetMe(yourName) {
          alert("Hello " + yourName)
        }
        console.log(eval('3 + 5'))
      </pre>
        <h3>Multi-line input in the Web Console</h3>
        <p>The single-line input mode of the Web Console is great for quick testing of JavaScript expressions, but
          although you can execute multiple lines, it's not very convenient for that. For more complex JavaScript, you
          can use the multi-line line input mode.</p>
        <h3>Hello world</h3>
        <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Web Console in multi-line mode, and write your first "Hello
          world" JavaScript code:</p>
        <pre>
      (function(){
        "use strict";
        /* Start of your code */
        function greetMe(yourName) {
          alert('Hello ' + yourName);
        }
  
        greetMe('World');
        /* End of your code */
      })();
      </pre>
        <p>Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> (or click the Run button) to watch
          it unfold in your browser!</p>
        <p>In the following pages, this guide introduces you to the JavaScript syntax and language features, so that you
          will be able to write more complex applications.</p>
        <p>But for now, remember to always include the <code>(function(){"use strict";</code> before your code, and add
          <code>})();</code> to the end of your code. You will learn what these mean, but for now they can be thought of
          as doing the following:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Massively improve performance.</li>
          <li>Prevent stupid semantics in JavaScript that trip up beginners.</li>
          <li>Prevent code snippets executed in the console from interacting with one-another (e.g., having something
            created in one console execution being used for a different console execution).</li>
        </ol>

      <header>Basics</header>
      <article>
        <p>JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, C, and C++, but it has also been influenced by Awk, Perl,
          and Python.</p>
        <p>JavaScript is case-sensitive and uses the Unicode character set. For example, the word Früh (which means
          "early" in German) could be used as a variable name.</p>
        <code>let Früh = "foobar"</code>
        <p>But, the variable <code>früh</code> is not the same as <code>Früh</code> because JavaScript is case
          sensitive.</p>
        <p>In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated by semicolons (;).</p>
        <p>A semicolon is not necessary after a statement if it is written on its own line. But if more than one
          statement on a line is desired, then they must be separated by semicolons.</p>
        <p>ECMAScript also has rules for automatic insertion of semicolons (ASI) to end statements. (For more
          information, see the detailed reference about JavaScript's lexical grammar.)</p>
        <p>It is considered best practice, however, to always write a semicolon after a statement, even when it is not
          strictly needed. This practice reduces the chances of bugs getting into the code.</p>
        <p>The source text of JavaScript script gets scanned from left to right, and is converted into a sequence of
          input elements which are tokens, control characters, line terminators, comments, or whitespace. (Spaces, tabs,
          and newline characters are considered whitespace.)</p>
